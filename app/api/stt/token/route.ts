/**
 * POST-less BYOK mint: the renderer never holds the real Deepgram key.
 *
 * The key lives server-side only (auth.json → process.env in the desktop
 * app; .env.local in dev — same seam as OPENROUTER_API_KEY). A dictation
 * run starts here: mint a short-lived access token (TTL 300s — a run can
 * outlast the 30s default), the renderer opens its WebSocket to Deepgram
 * with it, and audio flows renderer → Deepgram directly, never through
 * this server. The token is only checked at the WebSocket handshake, so
 * long dictation sessions survive the TTL fine (Deepgram docs).
 *
 * NOTE: the key needs ≥ Member permission in the Deepgram console to call
 * /auth/grant (their docs, token-based auth FAQ) — plain read/transcribe
 * keys return FORBIDDEN here.
